SPECIAL NOTES FOR REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE UNDER IRIX 6.5

To get better performance from OSW under SGI Irix 6.5, use the following
procedure.  Note that you must have root access in order to access this
feature.

1)  Switch to user root (e.g., "su root")
2)  Type "root-osw" instead of "osw".  This executes the commands:

unlimit -h
unlimit
limit

You should now be able to enjoy dramatically improved real-time performance.
