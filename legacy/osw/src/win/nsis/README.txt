This directory can be used to build a Windows self-executing installer for 
OSW.  It requires NSIS, the NullSoft SuperPIMP Installation System, available
from nsis.sourceforge.net.  

To build the installer:

1) Download and install NSIS if you have not done so already.
2) Right-click on osw.nsi and select "Compile NSI with bz2"
3) After a brief period of time, a new file Setup.exe should appear in
   the directory.
4) That's it, you have an OSW Windows installer!
