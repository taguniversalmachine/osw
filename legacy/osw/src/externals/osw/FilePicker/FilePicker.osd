<xblock name="LongDescription">FilePicker opens a dialog box from which the user may select a file name to be used in another transform such as TextIn or TextOut.  The "-save" option should be specified if the file being chosen will be used for writing.  If "-save true" is specified, then the dialog box will display a "Save" message and allow the user input a file name that does not already exist.  (The user can still choose an existing filename in save mode, but the file may then be overwritten by a transform receiving the selected file name).</xblock>
