2. REQUIREMENTS

  OSW runs on Intel-compatible PC's running either Windows 2000/XP or 
Linux, Apple Macintosh computers running OS X, and SGI workstations running 
Irix 6.5 or later. A soundcard is also a good idea.  OSW will run without any 
soundcard installed, but it is not very exciting.  Any sound hardware 
supported by Windows (via ASIO or WDM), Mac OS X CoreAudio or Linux ALSA 
drivers should work, although the latency and quality will vary.  Any sound 
harware for SGI workstations supported by Irix should work as well.

  Tcl/Tk 8.2.x or higher is also required.  Most Linux distributions should
come with Tcl/Tk, consult the documentation of your distribution for more info.
The Windows installer for OSW contains it's own version of Tcl/Tk to be 
installed if not already present on your system.  Mac Tcl/TkAqua is available
from Apple's software site (click "Get OS X Software" from the apple menu).
For SGI versions, it is unfortunately necessary to download and compile the 
source code because SGI only distributed a binary for Tcl/Tk 8.0.4.

3. INSTALLATION

If you are installing a binary distribution, it should have this file, 
as well as files INSTALL.xxx (where xxx is your platform) 
that contain the installation instructions for pre-compiled versions.

3.1 COMPILING AND INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE DISTRIBUTION

If you are compiling a source distribution, first unpack the distribution
(you've probably done that already) and proceed to the "src" directory.
From this directory go to the appropriate platform directory "win", "linux",
"macosx", or "sgi".  In the platform directory you will find a file named 
"COMPILE.xxx" where "xxx" is the platform (same name as the directory).  
Follow the platform-specific instructions in that file.

4. READING THE DOCUMENTATION

Once you have OSW up and running, you can get documentation by clicking on
the Help menu and selecting "User Guide." which will automatically start your
Web browser (Explorer or Netscape or whatever under Windows, or Netscape on
Linux).  Since it just good old HTML, you can access the documentation from
the "html" subdirectory inside the directory where you installed OSW.

5. CONTACT INFO

This is always a work in progress, so your feedback is very important 
and very much appreciated.  Please send your comments and inquiries to
Amar Chaudhary (peoplestank@users.sourceforge.net), and put "OSW" somewhere 
in the subject to get a more timely response.

6. HOW TO HELP

  The best ways to help right now are:

	1)  Try out OSW
        2)  Join the mailing lists
	3)  Report bugs/annoyances
	4)  Write cool patches that can be used as tuturials
        5)  Let us know about your projects, whether artist, research or
            otherwise.


7. HAVE FUN!
