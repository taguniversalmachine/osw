<p>OSW can be run without its user interface as a <i>server</i>.  In this mode, users do not interact directly with the OSW application, but instead control it from other applications (including other instances of OSW) via <a href="osc.htm">OpenSound Control</a> messages.  As desribed in <a href="osc2.html">Appendix A</a> and the <a href="http://localhost:7775/OSW_DIR/tutorials/osc/invisible_patch.osw">invisible_patch</a> tutorial, OSC messages can be used to build and execute patches running in the server.</p>

<p>To run the OSW server, type <b>oswbin</b> at a command-line prompt.  This will start OSW with the usual initialization for MIDI and audio devices, but instead of bring up the user interface, it will say &quot;Watch and Wait&quot; and then wait for incoming OSC messages.</p>

<p><b>oswbin</b> has several command-line options for initialization (e.g., setting up audio drivers).  Some of these options differ according to platform.  To get a list of command-line options, type:</p>

<pre>
     oswbin --help
