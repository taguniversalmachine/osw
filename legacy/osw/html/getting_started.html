<h1 class="title">2. Getting Started With Open Sound World</h1>

<br>
<br>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class="title">2.1. What is Open Sound World?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Open Sound World, or OSW, is a development and run-time
environment that allows sound designers and musicians to process sound in
response to expressive real-time control. OSW employs a visual programming
environment in which users instantiate and connect graphical components,
called <i>transforms</i> to form programs, called <i>patches</i>. This model
of &ldquo;patching things together&rdquo; has a long and storied history in
computer music from early analog synths to modern programming environments
such as Max/MSP, jMax and Pd. Users of these environments will probably find
the OSW interface quite familiar, although there are several important differences.
OSW uses a more uniform model where everything is a transform (i.e., no messages
or constants floating around), connections between transforms are strongly
typed, and only one connection may enter or leave a particular outlet. OSW
is also highly dynamic and allows users to both edit transforms and manipulate
performance controls simultaneously, and change patches or the basic configuration
even while the audio is running.</p>
<h3 class="title">2.2. Starting OSW</h3>
You can start OSW by clicking on the program icon or typing &ldquo;osw&rdquo;
on a command line. In either case, you will be presented with the OSW visual
programming environment. It looks a bit like this:<br>
<br>
<div align="center"><img alt="The OSW Workspace" src="getting_started_files/image001.jpg"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal">To the left is a palette of &ldquo;docked&rdquo; transforms
that you can use to build your programs (of course, there are many more transforms
than these!). Taking up most of the screen are one or more <i>patch views
</i>representing open patches. Each time you create or load a new patch, a new
view is added.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now let&rsquo;s create a patch&hellip;</p>
<h3 class="title">2.3. The First Patch:&ldquo;HelloWorld&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">No programming document would be complete without first
showing you how to write a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program.&nbsp; Click
on the blank transform button <img src="getting_started_files/image003.gif">
and then move the mouse the place on an open patch view where you want to
place the new transform and click again to drop it. There will now be a blank
box on the patch window.<br>
</p>
<div align="Center"><img src="getting_started_files/image004.png" alt="blank transform"></div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Type <span class="transform">MessageBox
</span>into the blank box <br>
<div align="center">
<img src="getting_started_files/image007.jpg"><br>
</div>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">and either hit the Enter key or click outside the box.
This will create a new <a class="transform" href="osw/MessageBox.html">MessageBox</a> transform.<br>
</p>
<div align="Center"><img src="getting_started_files/image008.png" alt="message box in patch"><br>
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note that there is a transform on the dock that looks
somewhat like this one. Indeed, MessageBoxes are used so often that that
you can create them by clicking on the docked copy and then clicking on your
patch. Do this to create a second <span class="transform">MessageBox</span>.</p>
<div align="Center"><img src="getting_started_files/image010.png" alt="Drag and drop message box prototype"><br>
<br>
<img src="getting_started_files/image012.png" alt="two message boxes"><br>
<br>
<div align="Left"><br>
</div>
<div align="Left">
<p class="MsoNormal">Now connect the first MessageBox to the
second one. Click on the <i>outlet</i> of the first MessageBox to create a &ldquo;wire&rdquo;and drag it
to left inlet of the other MessageBox. Click on the inlet to complete the
process.</span></p>
</div>
<img src="getting_started_files/image014.png" alt="inlets and oulets"><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="getting_started_files/image016.png" alt="Message boxes are connected"><br>
<br>
<div align="Left">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Now press the
red button and watch your message travel through the wire!</span></p>
<h2>2.4. Transforms: A More Detailed Look</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recall that we created a transform by typing a <i>command</i>
into a blank transform box. Try creating a sinewave transform by typing <span class="transform">
Sinewave</span>. This is a command that <i>instantiates</i> a new transform
whose <i>class name</i> is "Sinewave" and whose <i>instance name is</i> &ldquo;sinewave0.&rdquo;<br>
<img src="getting_started_files/sinewave2sinewave.gif"><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There may be many transforms of the same class (e.g.,
lots of sinewave oscillators), but each transform will have a unique instance
name. OSW will automatically assign an instance name to a new transform, but
you can optionally specify a name for the transform by using the &ldquo;-name&rdquo;
option. To create a sinewave transform called &ldquo;joe,&rdquo; type <span class="transform">
Sinewave &ndash;name joe</span> instead.<br>
<img src="getting_started_files/joe.gif"><br>
</p>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;-name&rdquo; is just one example of an option
you can specify when instantiating a new transform. For example, if you wanted
to specify an initial frequency of 256.1 Hz for your sinewave transform called
&ldquo;joe,&rdquo; type the command <span class="transform">
Sinewave &ndash;name joe &ndash;freq 256.1</span>. All transforms have
the &ldquo;-name&rdquo; option, but most other options are specific to the
transform class (refer the help page for a particular transform class to
find out its options).</p>
<h3 class="title"><i>2.4.1 Transform Completions</i></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You might have noticed that OSW transforms often have
long names like &ldquo;MessageBox&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sinewave&rdquo; &ndash;
these are relatively short examples. Long descriptive names are easier to
remember and also help users understand the function of the transform, but they
also require more typing. Fortunately, OSW removes the need to type full
transform class names through a feature called <i>transform completion</i>
. For example,you could just type &ldquo;Mess&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Sine followed by the Escape key to automatically complete the
class name:<br>
<img src="getting_started_files/escape.gif"><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If two or more transforms match what you typed, OSW
fills in the common letters and displays a list of all the matched transforms:<br>
<img src="getting_started_files/midicomplete.jpg"><br>
</p>
<br>
<h3 class="title"><i>2.4.2 Exploring Transforms</i></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Transforms display &ldquo;tool tip&rdquo; messages that
describe their behavior. Leave the mouse over the body of a transform to
see a brief description of its function. You can also learn about inlets
and outlets of a transform this way.<br>
<img src="getting_started_files/image040.png"><img src="getting_started_files/image042.png"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those who find tool tips more annoying than helpful
can turn them off in the Help menu. The same help information is also displayed
in the status bar at the bottom of the window.<br>
</p>
<h3 class="title"><i>2.4.3 Getting Help on Transforms</i></h3>
<p>You can get help on any transform by selecting it and using the F1 key.  This will bring up a web document describing the inlets, outlets and options for a transform:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="getting_started_files/sinewaveselect.png" align="center">
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="getting_started_files/f1.png" align="center">
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="getting_started_files/webpage.png" align="center">
</div>
<p>If it is available and OSW is running, a patch demonstrating the use of the transform will also be loaded.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="getting_started_files/helppatch.png">
</div>
<h2>2.5. Working with Patches</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Patches are to OSW as documents are to word processor:
they are the things that you create, edit and store in files. We have already
seen how you can build patches by instantiating and connecting transforms.
You can save your patch by using the Save command in the File menu, or clicking
the Save icon <img src="getting_started_files/image044.gif" alt="piggy">
in the view for your patch. You can also Open and Close patches using the
appropriate commands in the File menu or icons in a patch view.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Patches are themselves transforms, which can be included
in other patches. To add a patch from a file, type the name of the patch
into a blank transform. If the patch file is in another directory, you will
need to specify an absolute or relative path to that directory (if you don&rsquo;t
know what an absolute or relative path is, check your OS documentation).
You can also use the <span class="transform">Patch</span>
 transform to add a new subpatch that will be saved in the same file as the
patch you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<h2>2.6. Cutting, Copying and Pasting</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">OK, so now you can build, save and load patches. Unless
you never make mistakes, you will probably want to make changes to your patches
as you build them. OSW supports the standard Cut, Copy and Paste operations
on transforms. To select a transform, click on its border. You can select
multiple transforms by holding down the Shift key while you click on each
transform&rsquo;s border. Alternatively, you could draw a region around the
transforms you want to select. For more fun with drawing regions, see the
<a href="#gestural">Gestural Commands</a> section.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once transforms are selected, you can use the Cut, Copy
and Paste commands in the Edit menu. These operations work both within and
between patches.</p>
<h2>2.7. Annotating Your Patches</h2>
<p>You can add comments and annotations to your patches using
the “Insert Annotation” command in the Edit menu or the Annotation icon
<img src="./getting_started_files/image045.gif"> in the patch view. This command will add a new “sticky note” to your patch. You can then type in whatever comments you want.<br>
<div align="center"><img src="./getting_started_files/image046.png"></div><br>
You can also insert titles (i.e., lines of text without the “sticky-note” look), images and hyperlinks.
</p>
<a name="gestural"/>
<h2>2.8. Gestural Commands</h2>
<p>In addition to
traditional point-and-click editing, users can perform some common tasks by
drawing gestures on the patch window. You might have already noticed that you can “draw” on the patch window
by clicking and dragging the mouse. If
you draw a figure around one or more transforms, it selects them for moving,
cutting or copying:
<div align="center"><img src="./getting_started_files/image048.png"></div>
</p>
<p>Drawing a figure around an outlet creates a wire that you
can drag to an inlet (same as clicking on the outlet). Enclosing both an inlet and an outlet in a figure automatically connects them:<br>
<div align="center"><img src="./getting_started_files/image050.png">
<br><br>
<img src="./getting_started_files/image052.png">
</div>
</p>
<p>Editing-by-drawing might seem a bit odd at first, but it can
really help speed up all that tedious moving and connecting of transforms. Future versions of OSW will likely expand
this facility.</p>
<h2>2.9. Where to go from here</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>If you're the type who easily gets bored reading documents,
you can jump right in to the Tutorial Patches, or <a href="Transform_by_group.html" target="_top">explore the transforms</a> available for your OSW projects.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can read more about the <a href="details.html">details of OSW</a>, including how to <a href="making_music.htm">compose music</a> and <a href="signal_processing.htm">process audio signals</a>.</p>
